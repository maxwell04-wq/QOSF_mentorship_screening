# Quantum Multiplier

In this notebook, a quantum multiplier has been implemented as proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5949.pdf). This employs the use of a Draper adder (an adder which employs Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)) to efficiently evaluate the partial sums of the product.

Following is the outline of the notebook:
-  QFT
- Draper Adder
- Quantum Multiplier
- `multiplier` module
- Test run
- Future work
